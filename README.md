## About

This web app creates a place to advertise local businesses. The advantage of using this is the ability for the businesses to not only advertise themselves, but sell according to their strengths, as they have full control in how to advertise.

They also may create listings circadianly, as in they may create it on a day-to-day basis by what products or services they're offering that day. E.g. daily specials for restaraunts, limited shop items, and testimonials.

The goal is to create a network for people who want to discover less popular hidden gems in their area, or experience something completely new, while supporting these local businesses.

This was conceptualized from seeing my favorite restaraunts, and small business owners have to foreclose due to the COVID 19 pandemic.

## Technicalities

The stack used is MongoDB with help from packages Mongoose, Express, and others. Node for package management and running the server, and React as our client framework.
